This is 0x19-postmortem project.
A postmortem is an analysis or evaluation conducted after an event, typically a failure or incident, to understand what went wrong and how to prevent similar issues in the future. It often involves:

1. Reviewing Events: Analyzing the sequence of events leading up to the incident.

2. Identifying Causes: Determining the root causes of the failure, whether they are technical, procedural, or human-related.

3. Gathering Feedback: Collecting input from team members involved in the incident to gain different perspectives.

4. Documenting Findings: Compiling the information into a report that outlines the causes, impacts, and lessons learned.

5. Action Items: Recommending specific actions or changes to processes to improve future performance and prevent recurrence.

Postmortems are commonly used in fields like software development, project management, and healthcare to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
